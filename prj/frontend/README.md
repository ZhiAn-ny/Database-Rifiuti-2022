# Dev Notes
The application is currently using the indigo-pink material theme. To switch to bootstrap's theme, paste the following line in the "styles" section in angular.json. 

For Bootstrap:
	`"node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"`

For Material:
    `"./node_modules/@angular/material/prebuilt-themes/indigo-pink.css"`

In both cases, you should leave the following line:
    `"src/styles.css"`
